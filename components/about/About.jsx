              Hey there! I crave experiences that leave a mark on the world. Working at two early-stage start-ups was an absolute blast â€“ not only did I learn invaluable lessons, but I also collaborated with incredible minds, making a real impact on the projects. Additionally, I value innovative ideas and have had the opportunity to work with some wonderful research labs and advisors at CMU as well as UPitt. I am interested in machine learning, ethical AI, optimization, and learning theory!
